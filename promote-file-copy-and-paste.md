## 📣 [**HouseLearning**](https://houselearning.github.io) — *A Free Interactive Learning Website!*

Hey everyone!

I recently built a website called [**HouseLearning**](https://houselearning.github.io) — it’s a **free, interactive platform** where you can:

- ✅ **Play educational games**
- ✅ **Explore interactive tools**
- ✅ **Learn random cool stuff** from tech to math to trivia
- ✅ **All completely free and browser-based**

It’s hosted on **GitHub Pages** and regularly updated with new tools and games I’m making.

---

### 🔥 *Some Highlights:*

- 🎮 **Classic-style math games**
- 🖥️ **Web apps and utilities** (like a code runner, pixel art maker, and more)
- 🧠 **Learning tools for students, kids, or anyone bored at 3AM**

### 🔗 *Check it out here:*

If you give it a look, I’d seriously appreciate **feedback** — what works, what sucks, and what you think should be added next. Always down to **collab or take feature requests** too.

Thanks Reddit fam 🙌
